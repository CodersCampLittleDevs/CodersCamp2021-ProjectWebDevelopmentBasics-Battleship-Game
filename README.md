## <a name="features">Features</a>
- The main pages contains menu where we can start game, learn how to play, check highscores, see authors or go into settings where we can change our name.
- Before each game user should check his name and change it if it is nessecary
- After entering start game you have to place your ships on board by clicking **Randomize** button. If you are glad of place for your ships you can start game by clicking **Lets' play!**
- Your task is to destroy float of your opponent or destroy as much possible fields until time's up.
- After game will be displayed modal with result of the game and points you have scored. If your points were enough you have chance to become part of highscores tables.

**Figma**
Using Figma, we created our own prototype of a user interface adapted to Desktop, and also made a version adapted to display on Phones. All designs can be viewed [here](https://www.figma.com/file/L3ST1JTUOGIZWQIoF0G0nR/Battleship?node-id=0%3A1).
