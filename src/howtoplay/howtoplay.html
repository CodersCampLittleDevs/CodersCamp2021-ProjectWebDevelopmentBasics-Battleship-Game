            <p class="text">Battleship is a single-player game versus AI. Your goal is to be the first to sink all of your opponent's ships. 
                The game starts by clicking the Start Game button and then the Randomize button, which places your ships randomly on 
                the board. The game is played on two boards: yours and AI’s. Ships can be placed horizontally or vertically and cannot 
                overlap. They have different sizes: 1 of each 5-, 4-, 3- square ship and 2 of each 2-, 1- square ships. The shot 
                is made by clicking on the desired square on the opponent's board. For each successful hit on an AI’s ship, you get 1 point 
                and an additional point for sinking the ship. The best scores are recorded in high scores. You can change the name displayed 
                in the high scores by entering your name and saving it in the Settings before the start of the game, otherwise the score 
                will be saved under the default name Player.<br>Good luck, sailor!
