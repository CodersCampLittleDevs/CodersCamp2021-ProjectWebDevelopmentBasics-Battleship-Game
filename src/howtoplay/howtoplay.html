            Battleship is a single-player game versus AI. Your goal is to be the
            first to sink all of your opponent's ships. The game starts by
            clicking the Start Game button and then the Randomize button, which
            places your ships randomly on the board. The game is played on two
            boards: yours and AI’s. Ships can be placed horizontally or
            vertically and cannot overlap. They have different sizes: 1 of each
            5-, 4-, 3- square ship and 2 of each 2-, 1- square ships. The shot
            is made by clicking on the desired square on the opponent's board.
            For each successful hit on an AI’s ship, you get 1 point and an
            additional point for sinking the ship. The best scores are recorded
            in high scores. You can change the name displayed in the high scores
            by entering your name and saving it in the Settings before the start
            of the game, otherwise the score will be saved under the default
            name Player.
